# wall_follower

Uses PID control to find and follow a wall.

# How to run
Start roscore, $ roscore
Start up a world, for example: $ roslaunch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_stage_1.launch
Start up the node, $ rosrun wall_follower wall_follower.py

I could not get the robot to follow a wall. It spins.
